# AQI Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 🌍 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using machine learning techniques based on various atmospheric pollutant concentrations. Accurate AQI predictions can help governments, citizens, and environmental agencies take proactive measures to ensure public health and environmental safety.

---

## 📦 Dataset
The dataset includes pollutant concentration levels and their corresponding AQI values.

### 📊 Features:
- PM2.5
- PM10
- NO
- NO2
- NOx
- CO
- SO2
- O3
- NH3
- Toluene
- Benzene
- City

### 🎯 Target:
- AQI (Air Quality Index)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning Models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

---

## 📈 ML Models Used
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**

The model performances were compared using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

---

## 📌 Results
- The best-performing model achieved an **R² score of approximately _X.XX_** (update with your result).
- Feature importance showed **PM2.5**, **NO2**, and **PM10** as major contributors to AQI.
